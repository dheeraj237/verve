# Verve Vercel Deployment - Fix Summary

## ✅ Fixed: Lock File Warning

### The Issue
Vercel Console showed warning:
```
⚠️  "warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files 
generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix..."
```

**Reason**: Project had both `package-lock.json` (npm) and `yarn.lock` (Yarn), causing a package manager conflict.

### The Solution
1. ✅ Removed `package-lock.json` from the repository
2. ✅ Added `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` to `.gitignore`
3. ✅ Committed changes: `chore: fix package manager consistency`
4. ✅ Pushed to GitHub (triggers auto-deployment)

### Network Connection Retries
The other messages you saw in the logs:
```
info There appears to be trouble with your network connection. Retrying...
```
These are **normal** - Vercel is just retrying package downloads during the build. They don't indicate a failure.
